# Safecracker
PIN bruteforcer intended for ARK: Survival Evolved, written in AutoHotkey w/ GUI


Make sure Ark is already running, and you are looking at the intended vault!
Set your resolution to 1600x900 and WindowedFullscreen.


Define Start and Stop points using the respective fields, select the reverse box if you would like, and hit Start. The program should pull the Ark window to the front and begin entering PINs, starting from where you define and stopping when it detects the vault has opened, or reaches the specified Stop.
